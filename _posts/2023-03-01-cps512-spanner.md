# Spanner: Google's Globally-Distributed Database

## Multi-version
## Synchronously-replicated
## Externally-consistent
## Clock Uncertainty
## Non-blocking reads
## Lock-free read-only transactions
## Atomic Schema Changes

## BigTable Limitations
"Bigtable can be difficult to use for some kinds of applications: those that have complex, evolving echemas, or those that want strong consistency in the presence of wide-area replication"

## What is semi-relational?


## How does number of replicas improve read performance?

## Consistency Model
External consistency (linearizability) using timestamp, how?

## TrueTime API
"The API directly exposes clock uncertainty, and the guarantees on Spanner's timestamps depend on the bounds that the implementation provides."\
What is uncertainty?
